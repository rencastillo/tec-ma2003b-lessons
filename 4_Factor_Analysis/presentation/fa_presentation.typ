= Introduction to Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis

== Why Dimensionality Reduction?

Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental technique in multivariate analysis that seeks to:

- Handle high-dimensional data effectively
- Reduce computational complexity
- Remove noise and redundancy
- Improve model interpretability
- Enable data visualization

== Two Main Approaches

- *Principal Component Analysis (PCA)*: Data-driven approach, variance maximization
- *Factor Analysis (FA)*: Model-based approach, identification of latent constructs

= Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

== What is PCA?

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms correlated variables into uncorrelated principal components, maximizing the variance along each new axis and ordering the components by explained variance.

== Mathematical Foundation

Given a data matrix $bold(X)$ with $n$ observations and $p$ variables:

1. Center the data: $bold(X)_"centered" = bold(X) - overline(bold(X))$
2. Calculate the covariance matrix: $bold(S) = (1/(n-1)) bold(X)_"centered"^T bold(X)_"centered"$
3. Find eigenvalues $lambda_i$ and eigenvectors $bold(v)_i$ of $bold(S)$
4. Principal components: $bold("PC")_i = bold(X)_"centered" bold(v)_i$

== PCA Example

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Simple 3x2 data matrix
X = np.array([[5, 3],
              [3, 1],
              [1, 3]])

# Apply PCA
pca = PCA()
X_transformed = pca.fit_transform(X)

# Results
eigenvalues = pca.explained_variance_
variance_ratio = pca.explained_variance_ratio_

print(f"Eigenvalues: {eigenvalues}")
print(f"PC1 explains {variance_ratio[0]:.1%} of variance")
```

== Key Results

- PC1 explains the most variance (highest eigenvalue)
- Components are uncorrelated by construction
- Original data can be reconstructed from the components

== Component Retention Criteria

- *Kaiser Criterion*: Keep components with $lambda_i > 1$
- *Scree Plot*: Look for the "elbow" in the eigenvalue plot
- *Cumulative Variance*: Retain enough components for the desired variance (e.g., 80%)
- *Parallel Analysis*: Compare with eigenvalues of random data

= Factor Analysis

== What is Factor Analysis?

Factor analysis assumes that observed variables are linear combinations of common factors (shared latent constructs) and unique factors (variable-specific variance).

== The Common Factor Model

For each observed variable $x_j$:

$x_j = mu_j + sum_(i=1)^m lambda_(j i) f_i + epsilon_j$

Where:
- $lambda_(j i)$: Factor loading (correlation between $x_j$ and $f_i$)
- $f_i$: Common factor (latent variable)
- $epsilon_j$: Unique factor (error term)

== Factor Analysis Example

```python
import numpy as np
from factor_analyzer import FactorAnalyzer

# Correlation matrix
R = np.array([[1.00, 0.60, 0.48],
              [0.60, 1.00, 0.72],
              [0.48, 0.72, 1.00]])

# Perform Factor Analysis
fa = FactorAnalyzer(n_factors=1, rotation=None)
fa.fit(R)

# Results
loadings = fa.loadings_
communalities = fa.get_communalities()
uniqueness = fa.get_uniquenesses()

print(f"Factor loadings:\\n{loadings}")
print(f"Communalities: {communalities}")
print(f"Uniquenesses: {uniqueness}")
```

== Key Concepts

- *Loadings*: Correlations between variables and factors
- *Communalities*: Variance explained by common factors
- *Uniquenesses*: Variable-specific variance

== Factor Rotation

Factor rotation is a technique applied after factor extraction to make factors easier to interpret. It "rotates" the factor axes to achieve *simple structure*: each variable should load highly on only one factor and low on others.

*The problem:* Initial extraction often produces factors where many variables have moderate loadings on multiple factors, making interpretation difficult.

*The solution:* Rotation redistributes variance among factors without changing the total variance explained.

*Two main types:*

- *Orthogonal rotation* (e.g., Varimax): Keeps factors uncorrelated (independent)
  - Simpler interpretation, but may be unrealistic if constructs actually correlate

- *Oblique rotation* (e.g., Promax, Oblimin): Allows factors to correlate
  - More realistic for real-world data, slightly more complex interpretation

  [Promax], [Oblique rotation], [Factors may correlate], [Realistic models],
  [Quartimax], [Simplify variables], [Balance factors], [General use],
  [Oblimin], [Oblique rotation], [Flexible correlation], [Complex data]
)

== Why Rotate?

- Improve the interpretability of factor loadings
- Achieve "simple structure" (variables that load highly on few factors)
- Different rotations can reveal different substantive interpretations

== When to Use Each Method

=== Use PCA when:
- Data reduction is the main goal
- No theoretical model exists
- All variance is of interest
- Prediction is the objective
- Data visualization is needed

=== Use Factor Analysis when:
- Identifying latent constructs
- The analysis is theory-driven
- Developing a measurement model
- Understanding relationships between variables
- Performing scale validation/development

= Complete Analysis Workflow

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from factor_analyzer import FactorAnalyzer
from factor_analyzer.factor_analyzer import calculate_kmo, calculate_bartlett_sphericity

# 1. Load and prepare data
X = np.random.randn(100, 5)  # Your data here

# 2. Standardize
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# 3. Check suitability for FA
kmo_all, kmo_model = calculate_kmo(X_scaled)
chi_square_value, p_value = calculate_bartlett_sphericity(X_scaled)

print(f"KMO: {kmo_model:.3f} (>0.6 is good)")
print(f"Bartlett's test p-value: {p_value:.3f} (<0.05 is good)")

# 4. Determine number of factors
pca = PCA()
pca.fit(X_scaled)
eigenvalues = pca.explained_variance_
n_factors = sum(eigenvalues > 1)  # Kaiser criterion

# 5. Perform Factor Analysis
fa = FactorAnalyzer(n_factors=n_factors, rotation='varimax')
fa.fit(X_scaled)

# 6. Compare results
loadings = fa.loadings_
communalities = fa.get_communalities()
variance_explained = fa.get_factor_variance()
```
